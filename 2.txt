Hey There,
My name is Krishna Agarwal and I define my self as a curious learner and I want to learn something new every day.

I define myself as a 'Explorer' in one word.

Ever since I was a little kid, I used to be amazed by Websites and Apps and wondered how the thing's worked.

That's how I started taking interest in coding and developing as I grew up.

I am also practicing Google Cloud's GCP & GKE.

Since my childhood, I have enjoyed doing these things crayon drawings, reading stories, music to toy cars.

My hobbies include reading non fictional stories, making new innovation's and learning new things and skills.

I have experience to build Professional apps in Thunkable.

My aim is to make amazing innovations.
